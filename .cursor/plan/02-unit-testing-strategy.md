# Unit Testing Strategy Plan

## Overview
This plan establishes a comprehensive unit testing strategy for all business logic, utilities, and API handlers using Jest. The goal is to ensure high test coverage, maintainability, and confidence in code changes, while leveraging contract testing for API endpoints.

## Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup

### 1.1 Jest Configuration
- [ ] Install and configure Jest for the project
- [ ] Set up `jest.config.js` with TypeScript support
- [ ] Add test scripts to package.json

### 1.2 Directory Structure
- [ ] Create `__test__/` or `tests/` directory
- [ ] Organize tests by feature/module
- [ ] Add sample test files for Zod schemas, DB queries, and API handlers

## Phase 2: Test Coverage and Best Practices

### 2.1 Core Logic Coverage
- [ ] Write unit tests for all utility functions
- [ ] Write unit tests for Zod schemas (validation, edge cases)
- [ ] Write unit tests for DB queries (mocked DB)

### 2.2 API Handler Coverage
- [ ] Write unit tests for all API route handlers
- [ ] Mock dependencies and external services
- [ ] Ensure error handling and edge cases are tested

## Phase 3: Contract and Integration Testing

### 3.1 Contract Testing
- [ ] Set up `jest-openapi` for contract tests
- [ ] Write tests to validate API responses against OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Add contract tests for critical endpoints

### 3.2 Integration Testing
- [ ] Use `supertest` for HTTP integration tests
- [ ] Test end-to-end flows for key features
- [ ] Add test data and mocks as needed

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- Complete Phase 1 (Jest setup)
- Start Phase 2 (Core logic tests)

### Week 2: Coverage
- Complete Phase 2 (API handler tests)
- Start Phase 3 (Contract/integration tests)

### Week 3: Polish
- Complete Phase 3 (Integration)
- Review coverage and refactor as needed

## Success Metrics

### Test Coverage
- [ ] 95%+ unit test coverage
- [ ] 100% contract test coverage for public APIs

### Code Quality
- [ ] Zero failing tests in CI
- [ ] Fast feedback on code changes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Flaky or slow tests
  - **Mitigation**: Use mocks, parallelize tests, optimize setup
- **Risk**: Incomplete coverage
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce coverage thresholds in CI

### Process Risks
- **Risk**: Developers skip writing tests
  - **Mitigation**: Make tests mandatory in PR reviews

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Jest
- jest-openapi
- supertest

### Internal Dependencies
- Business logic modules
- API handlers
- OpenAPI spec

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up Jest and directory structure
2. **Short-term**: Write core logic and schema tests
3. **Medium-term**: Add contract and integration tests
4. **Long-term**: Maintain and improve coverage

## Notes

- Update plan as new features are added
- Review test strategy quarterly
