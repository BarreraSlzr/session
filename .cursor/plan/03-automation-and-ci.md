# Automation and CI/CD Integration Plan

## Overview
This plan details the automation and CI/CD strategy for the project, focusing on validating sources of truth, automating code generation, contract testing, and deploying documentation. The goal is to ensure quality, consistency, and rapid feedback for all code changes.

## Phase 1: Validation Automation

### 1.1 Linting and Type Checking
- [ ] Add linting and type checking steps to CI
- [ ] Enforce zero lint/type errors before merge
- [ ] Document lint/type check scripts in README

### 1.2 OpenAPI and Schema Validation
- [ ] Add OpenAPI validation (Speakeasy, Redocly) to CI
- [ ] Validate Zod schemas and DB types
- [ ] Fail CI on validation errors

## Phase 2: Code Generation and Contract Testing

### 2.1 Codegen Automation
- [ ] Automate Kysely typegen in CI
- [ ] Automate SDK generation from OpenAPI
- [ ] Automate migration checks

### 2.2 Contract and Integration Testing
- [ ] Run contract tests (jest-openapi) in CI
- [ ] Run integration tests (supertest) in CI
- [ ] Collect and report coverage metrics

## Phase 3: Documentation and Deployment

### 3.1 Documentation Generation
- [ ] Automate API docs generation (Speakeasy, Redocly)
- [ ] Deploy docs to static hosting or API portal
- [ ] Add docs deployment to CI pipeline

### 3.2 Continuous Deployment
- [ ] Automate deployment to staging/production
- [ ] Add health checks and monitoring
- [ ] Notify team on deployment status

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- Complete Phase 1 (Validation automation)
- Start Phase 2 (Codegen/contract tests)

### Week 2: Automation
- Complete Phase 2 (Testing)
- Start Phase 3 (Docs/deployment)

### Week 3: Polish
- Complete Phase 3 (Deployment)
- Review and optimize pipeline

## Success Metrics

### Automation
- [ ] 100% of PRs validated by CI
- [ ] Automated codegen and docs for every change

### Quality
- [ ] Zero manual deployment steps
- [ ] Fast feedback (<10 min) for PRs

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: CI flakiness or slow builds
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize jobs, use caching, parallelize steps
- **Risk**: Missed validation/codegen
  - **Mitigation**: Block merges on failed checks

### Process Risks
- **Risk**: Team bypasses automation
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce checks in branch protection rules

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- GitHub Actions or CI provider
- Speakeasy CLI, Redocly CLI

### Internal Dependencies
- Lint/type check scripts
- OpenAPI spec, Zod schemas, DB types

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add validation and codegen to CI
2. **Short-term**: Automate contract tests and docs
3. **Medium-term**: Automate deployment
4. **Long-term**: Optimize and monitor pipeline

## Notes

- Update plan as automation needs evolve
- Review pipeline monthly
